**To put it in the simplest words that I can conjure up, React custom hooks are simply reusable functions that are composed of built-in hooks.**

<blockquote>
 IMPORTANT
Start by identifying repetitive logic across your components.
 Extract this logic into a function named with use prefix. Custom hooks should start with use, like useFormInput or useFetch.
 Use React's built-in Hooks within your custom Hook as needed.
 Return anything that will be useful for the component using this Hook.
 Each custom hook should be responsible for a single piece of functionality.
